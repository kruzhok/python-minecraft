`Minecraft: Pi Edition <http://pi.minecraft.net/>`__ is awesome.

However it uses Python 2. We're moving it to Python 3 (without any official
approval) and offering it for download here.

We hope this makes people's lives easier.


Project Priorities
------------------

1. Make it work on Python 3
2. Keep compatibility with the original release
3. Make the API cleaner and more Pythonic
4. Make the internals cleaner and more Pythonic

History
-------

At PyConUK 2014 a bunch of people sprinted on porting the Minecraft Python client to Python 3.
Great work was done, excellent progress was made, but in the process, a lot of backwards-compatibility was broken.

This is a do-over, with the above priorities - starting with tests based on existing tutorials and behaviour to ensure we don't break compatibility.

The previous iteration lives at https://github.com/py3minepi/py3minepi-legacy
